<div>
  here we can make some docs
</div>
<div>
  possibly in a way that is more readable and easy to find
</div>
<div>
  idea is to have a list of elements we're trying to reach -&gt; and for every element we want some samples and possibly a description or something...
</div>
<div>
  so, a glossary of the steps in a way
</div>
